### Narrow VLC-skin to save precious screen estate.

VLC-skin I made years ago with that terribly [outdated skin-editor](http://get.videolan.org/skin-editor/0.8.5/) 'cos vlc seems to become wider by every release and I usually have a lecture or podcast running on the side while working on something.

To install, just grab the 300_pixels.vlt file to your computer and change skin via VLC's settings.
